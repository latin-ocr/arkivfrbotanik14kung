Since my late father, Professor P. T. Cmvs, more than
twenty years ag0‚ in 1891, published his list of Finlandian
diatoms known up to that date, several other forms of these
algae, fossil or living, have on different occasions been ob-
served in Finland and partly registered. Thus P. T. CLEVE
himself, soon after his first publication, in 1894 investigated
a clay-deposit from Viborg, that was found to oontain, besides
,some diatoms considered typical for deposits from the Ancylus- ’
epoch, also a few marine species, and consequently proved
to be an interesting pendant to the deposit of Skattmanso'
in Uppland, Sweden. Among the Viborg-forms, nine were
new to Finland and will be quoted in this paper.

The plankton-investigations, that have at a later date
been carried out by Mr K. M. LEVANDER, have also enriched

'2 the flora of Finland with several forms, partly new to science.

ἦ Ι myself have had the opportunity, repeatedly, to examine
'numerous samples of earth, clay and turf from Finland, sent
