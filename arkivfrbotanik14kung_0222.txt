to me partly from the Geological Commission of that country,
but especially by Mr HARALD LINDBERG. There ought to be
mentioned on the first hand some rich series of consecutive
samples from different levels, taken by Mr LINDBERG at
Hindersmossen‚ in the parish of Karis, and at Kyrkslatt in
the parish of Vasterkulla‚ both localities situated in Nyland.
Furthermore a series from Panelia in Satakunta.

The largest contribution‚ however, is due to a collection
of chiefly marine remains, sent to me last year by Mr LIND-
BERG and labelled Knj'asha and Koudajarvenpaa, two places
situated in Russian Kaoelen, at the bottom of the bay of
Kandalaks.1

The Knjasha-material is of no little interest, as it proves
to contain not only such marine species, as are previously
known from the Fennoscandian deposits of the Litorina-
epoch‚ but also rather large quantities of numerous forms,
missing in the latter strata, but living in and characteristic
to the Arctic Sea. Many of these species and varities have
been described in earlier works by P. T. CLEVE and A. GRU-
Now, as well as in the later works by Mr E. OSTRUP con-
cerning marine, arctic diatoms (cfr the list of literature).
Another number of forms, common to the Arotic Sea and
the North Sea, have already at a much earlier date been
described and figured by mainly British naturalists, such as

GREGORY, W. SMITH and DONKIN.

As Mr LINDBERG will speak elsewhere of the Knjasha-
deposit‚ I shall not enter upon the subject from a geological
point of view, but confine myself to an illustration of its
biological contents. The following descriptions and drawings
are made from a series of slides, that belong to the Riks-
museum of Stockholm‚ where they are kept together with

the collectione of P. Τ. CLEVE.
Of the numerous marine species, found at Knjasha, all

hitherto known to science have also been registered from

 

 

² The two localities quoted above are not situated within the politica}
confines of Finland, accordingly, though they belong to the naturally better
limited boundary of Finland together with Russian Karelen and the penin-
sula of Kola‚ over which CLEVE's researches expanded. The present eon-
tributions just are from a section of Kar-elem the Kar-elia keretina, that
was not at all represented in the collection of sampies, upon which CLEVFJ
based his work.
