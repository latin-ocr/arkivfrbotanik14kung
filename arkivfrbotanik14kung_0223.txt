the Arotic Soa, except Caloneis fossilis and Nau. Libellus.
Several of the species may even be considered characteristic
to that sea, viz. Navicula (distans, Aclmantltes (cretica, ιδ’][ηςιίγτι
Ισαφηίεσῖιαίίσα, Ooscz‘nodi.÷=0us curvamus, I'odosz‘ra glacialis, and
others. Ι1 is thus obvious that 1116 strata in question have
been deposited by 1116 Arenio Sea ab an epoch, when 111111
basin spread over parts of 1116 present> Karelon, which opocli
probably was that of 1-116 old Anoylus-Sea.

In 1116 11111οᾶ11611011 of his »Diatoms of Finland», P. T.
CLEVE enumerabeS 1116 leading forms of some natural asso-
oiations of diatoms, characterising different conditions of
climate ancl water, especially wabers of more or less salinity.
We 111616 find 1116 association of braokish water, now living
along 1116 Baltic coasts of Finland‚ which proves 1ο have
some speeies, such as Epithemia tumida var. Westermannil,
M elosira Borreri, Coscinodiscus balticus, Campylodzfscus Olypeus
and 0. Echineis in common with 1116 -fossil flora of the Lito-
rina-deposits. By 1116 rich development of other species, such
as Rhabdonema arcuatum and minutum, Grammatophora ocea-
nica, Hyalodt'scus scoticus, Coscz‘nocliscus aster-omphalus a. 0.,
1116 latter, however, bears appearence of having lived in a
water of greater salinity, such as is now present, in 1116 most
southern parb of 1116 Baltic.

To those eoologioal associations, we ean now add one,
that may be called the marine-arctio formation. It contains,
among many other speeies of diatoms, the following more
abundantly:
