Besides, some species, frequent in Litorina-deposits, hav<¹
been met with in Some of the marine gatherings from Knjiislla
in a few specimens only, and generally in the uppcrmost
part of the marine strata, where also some freshwater specim,
such as for instance Cyclotella bodanica EULENST„ occur. I
therefore do not consider them as belonging to the genuine
marine-arctio association. They are:

N z'tzschia punctam (W. SM.) Campylodiscus C'lypeus ΕΗΒ.
GRUN. O. Echinai& ΕΗΒ.
Surirella striatula TURP.

There are to be noticed several cases of vicariating ex-
change between related forms in the association coming from
the Arctic Sea and that one, that arrived later with the
waters of the Litorina-Sea.

We thus find, among others,

As regards the marine-arctio diatoms, their development
in large and conspicuous forms seems to be a feature of
frequent occurrence, while on the contrary rather small,
sturdy forms are dominating in the remains from the La·-
torma-Sea* For instance Navz’cula latissima, N. Hennedyz',
