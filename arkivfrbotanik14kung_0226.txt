6 ARKIV 1⁴¹6ss BOTANIK. BAND 14. NtO 9.

Dz'plonez‘s Smithii and Mastoqloia elliptz‘ca have been found
in new, very large varieties. The fossil‚ arctio forms of
Hyalodz'scus stelliyer and of Rlzabdonema arcuatum are conside-
rably larger than the same species in the Litorina-Sea, or
now living at the West coast of chden. Together with Rhab-
donema minutum, we have the gigantic Rla. Oestrupiz' in the
same association.

By the richer flora, by the occurrence of many species
lacking in deposits from the Litorina-epoch, by the absence
of some characteristic »Litorium-forms and, finally, by the
often luxuriant development of the species,it does not generally
offer any difficulties to distinguish associations of fossss,
marine diatoms, deposited in the Finland of to·day during
an early-quaternary transgression of the Arctic Sea, from the
flora, imported at a later period by the waters of the Lito-
rina-Sea.

As to the systematic arrangement I have followed, for
the naviculoid forms, CLEVE's Synopsis, and for the rest
SCHUTT'S monography in »Die Natiirlichen Pflanzenfamilien»
by ENGLER δε PRANTL, part I, 16, p. 55—57, With the alter-
ations, proposed by QSTRUP in Danske Diatomeer.

The geographical distribution of the species and varieties
being of great importance for the elucidation of the geological
conditions under Which the diatomaceous strata have been
deposited, I have endeavoured to give an account of the
habitat and ‘the¹ area of each form. The datas used have
been furnished, as to the Naviculoid forms, by CLEVE’S
synopsis, completed with statements, given in the later papers
by Mr QSTRUP. As to the remaining Pennatae and the Cen-
tricae, my data are, no doubt, very incomplete‚ since I have
been prevented from lack of time to gather all the notices
scattered in numerous papers on the subject. As far as the
pelagio forms are concerned, however, the treatise given by
Mr GRAN in »Nordisches Plankton» III, p. 19, has been con-
sulted. Ι have also noticed the indications given in the
various works by CLEVE, Gmmow ard OSTRUP, mentioned
above.
