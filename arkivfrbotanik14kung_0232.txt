Diploneis Boldtiana CL. var. robusta n. var. Pl. l, f. 8.

Valve linear-elliptical with rounded ends, 28-40 μ. in
length, 14—16 μ in breadth. Furrows narrow, slightly bent
round the large, elliptical central nodule. Costae 8—9 in
10 μ.. Alveoli obsolete, rounded.

Foss.: Ab. Hindersmossen.

This form resembles D. Boldtz'ana CL., bun has a larger
central noclule and more distant costae. An intermediate
form with smaller nodule and 11 smooth costae in lO μ. was
observed in samples from Sat„ Panelia.

A few large specimens, fully agreeing with DONKIN’S
figure.

As an intermediate form between this species and D.
aestiva Ι might consider a Dz‘plonez'3‚ that is 40 μ in length,
20 μ in breadth, and has narrow furrows, very slightly widened
round the centra] nodule, that is elongated. The costae- are
9 in 10 μ and alternate with apparently single rows of very
fine lineolae.

Diploneis smithii (BREB.) —- Syn. Navicula elliptz'ca W.
SM. B. D. Tab. 17, f. 152 a. The main form is stated by
CLEVE to be 27—50 μ in length (Syn. Nav. D. I, p. 96).

A specimen, 60 μ. in length and thus graduating to the
following variety, was met with in Hindersmossen.
