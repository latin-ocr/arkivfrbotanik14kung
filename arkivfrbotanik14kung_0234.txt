14 ARKIV Fon BOTANIK. BAND 14. Nzo 9.

Foss: Kk. Knjasha‚ mixed with the typica] form.
Ι think these two forms may be distinguished from one
another, though CLEVE has united them.

Diploneis decipiens n. sp. —— Icon. nost. Pl. 1, f. ll.

Valve elongated elliptical, 30—35 μ in length, 12-18 μ
in breadth. Costae 9 in 10 μ, alternating with coarsely‚ but
obscurely pearled striae. Furrows close to the horns, slightly
widened round the central nodule, that is small.

Foss. (mar.): Kk. Knjasha„ not rare; Koudajarvenpaa.

This Diphneis, occurring in a purely marine society, is
certainly closely connected with szpl. elliptz'ca, from which
it is difficult to distinguish by any other character than the
obsolete punctuation. I first thought it possibly identic with
a Diplonei& figured by Mr OSTRUP in Danske D. Tab. 1, f. 17
(p. 24) and determined to D. borealis GRUN. But the striation
of the latter being that of D. Smitlcz‘i, the two forms must

be different. The form of Mx- Osmwp is also rather different ι

from the large and typica] D. borealis GRUN„ that is present
in some Knj'asha—samples.

Diploneis decipiens n. sp. var. parallela n. var. —- Pl.
1, f. 12.
Differs from the main form by a more delicate central

nodule and perfectly parallel furrows.
Foss.: Kk. Knjasha, sparingly among the type.

Diploneis Mauleri BRUN. D. Esp. nouv. Tab. 15, f. 7.
— CLEVE, Syn. Nav. D. I, p. 98.

Foss: Ka. Viborg-dep. (CLEVE 1894), Nyl. Hinders-
mossen‚ Kyrkslatt (Deposits from the Ancylus-epoch).

Distr. (fresh or slightly braclezlsh u*.): Vettern, Gulf of
Bothnia, Leman, Rammer moor, Sahara. (Foss.) Balt-ic de-
posits from the Ancylus-epooh.
