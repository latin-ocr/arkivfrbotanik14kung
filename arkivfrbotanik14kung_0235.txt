Foss.: Ab. Hindersmossen (Litorc'ua-dep.); Kk. Knjiisha
(marine dep.)‚ raro.

Distr. (mar.): Jutland (OSTRUP).

A few specimons seen, that resemble US'rl-:Uv's figure,
but are a little larger (L. 40 μ, Br. 9 μ.) and have 14 instead
of 18 striae iu 10 μ..

Gyrosigma HASSALL.
Gyrosigma Fasciola (Eue). — V. H. Syn. Tab. 21, f. 8.

Foss.: Ab. Hindersmossen. (Mixed strata from the An—
cylus- and Litorz‘na-epoehsl)

Distr. (mar.): West and East Aretie Sea, North Sea,
Atlantio and Paeifie oceans.

Navieulae Decipientes GRUN.

Navicula Crucicula W. SM. var. minor n. var. Pl. 1, f. 13.

Valve elliptic—lanceolate, with broad, truncate, sometimes
more protracted ends Length 30—50 μ, breadth 10—13 μ.
Axial area undistinet‚ eentral nodule transversely dilated as
in N. Crucicula. Striae slightly radiate, not distinctly punctate,
very fine except the three or four median ones, that are
strong, more distant and shortened.

Foss.: Ab. Hindersmossen (fresh uu).

This form, that is smaller than the typical Nav. Cruci-
cula, seems to connect that species with N av. subz‘nflata GRUN.
(CLEVE Vega-Exp. D. Tab. 37, f. 50). There is some confu-
sion in literature about Navicula Orucicula. If the remark-
able, transversely dilated centra] nodule‚ that is very distinct
in DONKIN’S figure (B. D. T. 6 f. 14) be considered a dominating
feature of this species, neither the valve, figured in V. H.
Tab. 10, f. 15, nor a variety, drawn by OSTRUP in Danske
Diat. Tab. 1, f. 30 ought to be referred to DONKIN’s speeies
The Danish form is perhaps identieal with Navicula Lund-
etv-&mii var. Frieseana GRUN., cfr. CLEVE Syn. NaV. D. I,
Tab. 5, f. 18.

Navicula gibbula CL. var. elliptica n. var.

Valve linear-elliptio with rounded ends, rlot truncate as
in the main form, described and figured by CLEvE in Syn.
Nav. D. Ι, p. 140, Tab. 5, f 17.

Foss.: Kk. Niemenkonk'aan alus; rare (fresh ua).
