Foss.: Kk. Knjiisha.
Some small, hyaline valves with a stauroid markiug across
the middle are possibly identical with this species.

PNavicula (Libellus ‘?) Klavsenii OSTR. var. turgida n. var.
— 1. 1, f. 14a, b.

Valve lanceolate‚ fusiform, gradually tapering towards
the narrow‚ rounded ends, very convex. Length 70 μ, breadth
15 μ. Striae fine, apparently smooth, parallel, equidistant‚
17 in 10 μ. Axia] area indistinct, central area small, circular.

Foss.: Kk. Knjasha‚ rare.

Distr. of the main form (mar.): E. Greenland (OSTRUP,
FarskV. D. fist-Gronl„ p. 281, Tab. 1, f. 13).

The Finlandian form, of which Ι give a figure in as well
valvar as zonar view, agrees in all respects, except in the
breadth of the valve being twice as large, with the Navicula
Klavsenii described by OSTRUP from East Greenland. As
to the nearest affinities of this species, I have been hesit-
ating between the groups of the Navz'culae Encoleiae CL. and
the Libelli. The convex, fusiform shape of the valve and
the fine, parallel striae recall Navicula inornata GRUN. among
the former, but there is no lanceolate axia] area as in this
species. On the other hand, though the convex valves re-
semblethose of a Libellus, the striation is rather different,
no puncta being visible. Were it not for the smooth striae,
it would seem closely allied to Libellus plicata. Perhaps the
nearest relations, thus, are to be found elsewhere, or among
the Naviculae Fusisormes CL. (Syn. Nav. D. Ι, p. 105), though
the species of this group have no central area.
