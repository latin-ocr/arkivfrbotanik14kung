A. CLEvE-EULER‚ DIA'r. FLORA oF FJNLAND. 19

Distr. (fresh or slightly bracle. w.): Gulf of Bothnia, Dan-
mark‚ England, Balaton-lake.

Cymbella (Encyonema) fennica n. sp. — Pl. l, f. 15.
Valve elongated rhombie—elliptical‚scarcely unsymmetri-

eal, obtuse, 44 μ, in length, 13 μ. in breadth. Areas small. Τετ-
minal fissures distant from the ends. Striae 10 in 10 μ,
radiate throughout, distinctly lineate.

Foss.: Ob. Pelso (fresh 102).

This small species is no doubt closely connected with
Cymbella lacuslris, from which it is distinguished by the
broader shape and by the striae being divergent also at the
ends. This feature is shown also by Cymbella Μὸἰῖενὶαηα
GRUN. (CLEVE, Syn. Nav. D. I, p. 167) that, however, has a
large, orbicular central area.

Cymbella (Encyonema) recta n. sp. Pl. 1, f. 16.
Valve strongly asymmetricaL semielliptical, centrally gib-

bous on both sides. Ends slightly protracted and inclined
downwards, subacute. Terminal nodules at a distance from
the ends, terminal fissures inclined downwards. Length 40 μ,
breadth 18 μ.. Striae 8 in 10 μ, punctate.

Foss.: Ab. Hindersmossen, rare (fresh w..?).

This species seems to be allied to Cymbella prostrata, as
well as Ο. Jordani GRUN. (emm, Syn. Nav. D. I, p. 169),
and also to a dorsally more arouate form, intermediate be-
tween Encyonema prostratum and Ε. caespitosum, drawn in
A. S. Atl. Tab. 11, f. 36, that perhaps is identical with Cym-
bella (Encyonema) tumida var. obtusa O. M. Bao. aus Siid-
Patag. Tab. 1, f. 19.

Cymbella lanceolata Kt'sz. var. inflata n. var. — Pl. 1,
f. 17.

Valve 110 μ. in length, 25 μ in breadth in the strongly
gibbous middle. Striae parallel to the ends, 7,5 (middle)—9
(ends) in lO μ, punctate.

Foss.: Ab. Hindersmossen, rare.

This form has the same number of striae as the var.
cornuta ΕΗΒ. (OSTRUP, Danske D. Tab. 2, f. 43), but is shorter
and more gibbous. A very similar, perhaps identical form is
Cymbella Uistula var. qibbosa BRUN from Switzerland (Diato-
miste Π, Tab 14, f. 27).
