24 ARKIV FoR ΒΟΤΑΝῙΚ. BAND 14. Nzo 9.

20 μ in length, 6 μ in breadth. Areas indistinct. Striae
slightly radiate, at the ends transverse, e. 18 in 10 μ..

Foss.: Kk. Knjasha (marine dep.).

QSTRUP gives in Mar. D. Ost-Gronl. Tab. 4, f. 30 a figure
of a small form, that Ι believe identical with the present one.
Mr QSTRUP refers it, with hesitation, to Navicula bahusz'ensis
GRUN., but 1 cannot join him in this determination, as the
latter is a broad, obtuse species, I believe in contrary-Na-
vicula ammophila to be the nearest relation, as this species
has acute ends and a similar striation.

Navicula cancellata DONK. var. subapiculata GRUN. —
A. S. Atl. Tab. 46, f. 66-68. Icon. nost. Pl. l, f. 19.

Foss: Kk. Knjasha.

Distr. (mar.): Greenland (OSTRUP), East Arctic Sea,
Baltic, Firth of Tay.

In Pl. 1, f. 25b Ι have drawn a frustule in zonar view,
showing the convex valves and the very narrow connecting
zone.

Navicula cancellata Dos-K. var. retusa Bane? — V. H.
Syn. Suppl. A, f. 9. — Icon. nost. Pl. l, f. 20.

Foss.: Kk. Knj‘asha.

Distr. (mar.): Greenland (OSTRUP), East Arctic Sea, North
Sea; ubiquist.

Some Finlandian specimens (cfr. the fig.) have are mark-
ably large, circular area. ·

Ι have also observed a frustulc with very convex valves,
that in zonar view is exactly similar to DONKIN’s figure of
Navicula sortis GREG. (B. D. Tab. 8, f. Sc), but as I have
not seen the valves in front view, I cannot warrant- the
identity.

Navicula distans (W. SM.) B. D. Tab. 18, f. 169. V. H.
Syn. Suppl. A, f. 18.

Foss: Kk. Knjasha, Koudajarvenpa'a‚ not rare.

Distr. (mar.): Greenland, East Arctic Sea.

According to CLEVE (Syn. Nav. D. II, p. 35), this species
is characteristic to the Arctic Sea and Northern Atlantic.
