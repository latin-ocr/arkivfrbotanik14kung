Striae divergent in the middle, convergent at the ends, 8¹s‘2.
—9 in 10 μ.

Foss.: Ab. Hindersmossen.

This form is most closely allied to P. Lequmen, though
the long and slender valves recall P. stauroptera. 11 cannot
be referred to this species because of the inflations near
the ends. I have also found it, in P. T. CLEVE’S notes, from

Lake Rosslangen in Sweden and froin Loch Kinnord in Scot-
land.

Valve almost linear, slightly triundulate‚ With broad,
oapitate ends, 80 μ 111 length, 16 μ 111 breadth. Area less
broad than in the preceding variety.

Foss.: Ab. Hindersmossen (fresh w.).

Distr. (fresh w.): Italy.

Seems to graduate to the var. lonqa. Shorter, typieal
specimens have a great resemblance to Pinnularia platy-
cephala (EHB.) CL. from which speeies they, however, differ
by the end-fissures being turned in the same direction.

Valve linear-lanceolata gradually tapering from the middle
to the broad, obtuse-truncate ends, very slightly triundulate.
811136, ll in 10 μ, interrupted in the middle of the valve,
where there is a large, rhomboid area. Length 67 μ, breadth

Foss.: Ab. Hindersmossen‚ Οκ. Paltamo (fresh w.).

This form has much the same outline as Pinnularia ka-
relica CL„ but is a little more coarsely built throughout and
has a broader axial area. Ι1 6011166 perhaps as near 10 Ρ.
mim-ostauron as 10 P. diver-ymas.
