Ρ. Τ. CLEVE does not distinguish this species, that has
the general aspect of Pz'omularz'a pendensi& GRUN. (a more
closely striate, American speeies), from P. kemiptera KthZ„
probably for the reason that both species have the same
number of striae. Nevertheless, they are certainly different,
as I could satisfy myself by studying the samples from Hin-
dersmossen, where both occur together. The true Pinnvlaria
kemiptera is a eoarsely built, rather short, linear-cuneate
speeies, sometimes with a more or less visible band across
the strong striae, as in the Pz'mzularz'ae majores CL. I have
drawn two specimens in Pl. 1, f. 28, a, b. P. hybrida has
finer striae, though the valves are larger and sometimes reaoh
the remarkable dimensions of 30 >< 215 μ; besides it is more
gently tapering from the middle, less ouneate than P. he-
miptera.

In have found in CLEVE's manuscripts drawings, evidently
representing P. hybrida, from Rosslangen in Sweden (›>P.
hemiptera Var.2›>) and from Szta Fiora (›>P. instabilis A. SCHM.2›>).

Distr. (fresh w.): Sweden, lake Rosslangen (Kalmar lenm
America.

As there is no authentia figure of this strongly triundu-
late, oapitate form, I have drawn it in ΡΙ. 2, f. 35. Specimens
from Finland often have the area punctate, as stated in CLE-
VE’s diagnosis. The median inflation is frequently larger than
the two others (as in the var. Formica EHB„ from America).
The pune-tate form eomes near to P. acrosplzaeria BRF'JB.

Pl. 2, f. 34.
Valve linear, with broad, suboapitate, somewhat euneate

ends. Length 63 μ, breadth 10 μ (middle). Axial area broad,
about a third of the breadth of the valve. Central area a
transverse fascia. Striae parallel, 10 in 10 μ.

Foss: Kk. Niemenkonkaan alus rare (fresh w.).
