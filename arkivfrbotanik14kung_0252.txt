forms. It no doubt comes nearest to Pinn. flexuosa CL. var.
cuneata, a Danish form, recently described and figured by
ΜΓ OSTRUP in Danske D. Tab. 3, f. 76; and I think it ought
to be regarded as a constricted form of this species, that
had better be distinguished from the much larger and still
more coarsely striate, round-ended American species Pinn.
flexuosa.

Another form, that ought to bc mentioned in this place,
is »Pinnularia sp.», figured by OSTRUP in Danske Geol. For.
Medd. n:o 6 (1900), Tab. l, f. 4. It agrees in all respects
with the Finlandian fossil variety of P. cuneata, except in
the curious arrangement of the striae, that according to the
figure are convergent in the middle and divergent at the
ends. But as the text states the striae to be inclined in
exactly the opposite way, the drawing may be wrong on this
point.

I am not quite sure of this small form — of. which I
have seen only one specimen —- being a Pinnuzarz'a, as it
shows a great resemblance to the frustule of Navicula can-
cellam var. retusa that I have drawn in fig. 20. Should
they be identical, the latter determination cannot be correct,
the striae being parallel and not divergent, as in Navicula
