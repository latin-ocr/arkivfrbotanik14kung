original A. Proteus of GREGORY. This is, to judge from GRE-
GORY's figures, a large species, attaining until 125 μ in length,
though CLEVE states only 40——65 μ, and distinguished from
the closely related Amphora robusta by the ventral striae
being interrupted by a blank band, widening towards the
centrum. A. robusta has a band of uninterrupted ventral
striae generally of equal length along the median lines. In
the Knjasha-samples, I have seen many frustules of What I
believe to be a genuine Amphora Proteus, about 80 μ in length,
With 9 coarsely punctate striae in 10 μ.

Foss.: Kk. Knjasha, rare.

Distr. (mar.): East Arctic Sea.

CLEVE has not kept this form a distinct variety, but it
is smaller than the main form, only 45 μ in length, and has

only a single row of striae, on the ventral side, except near
the ends.
