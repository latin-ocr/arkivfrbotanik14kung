line. For the same reason this form cannot belong to Am-
phora arenicola anymore than to A. robusta, and I thus have
been obliged to alter CLEVE’s name. The said line is dist-
inct-ly visible only in dorsal, not in ventral vieW‚ why CLEVE
may not have observed it.

The size and number of striae agree well with CLEVE’S
description. The longitudinal line is faint, but distinct.

Amphora Lindbergii n. sp. — Pl. 2, f. 46 a, b.

Valve lunate acute, with arcuate dorsal and slightly ar-
ouate, centrally somewhat gibbous ventral margin. Length
75 μ, breadth 12—1521.. Median line biarcuate. No axial
area3 central area on the dorsal side small, rounded, on the
ventral a little larger. Striae 10 in 10 μ, not punctate, but
interrupted on the dorsal side by three blank, longitudinal
lines. Ventral side marrow, striate, especially towards the
ends. Connecting zone?

This species is perhaps alliecl to Amphora virqata DSTR.
(D. N.-E. Greenl. Tab. 13, f. 12), but is certainly different,
as will be seen by a comparison of the figures. As I
have- only seen some valves, nothing can be stated about the
connect-ing zone, and it is thus uncertain to what section of
the genus Amphora this form belongs.

I have seen but one example of this interesting diatom,
known only from East Greenland. It agrees well with QSTRUP’S
description. Still, as the puncta stand much closer than is
seen on QSTRUP'S figure, I give a drawing of it in fig. 47..
