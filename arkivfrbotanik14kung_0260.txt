Cocconeis sp. — Pl. 4, f. 88.

This small form somewhab recalls Cocconeis Disculus, as
it has been drawn by OSTRUP, but can hardly be a form of
that species, the puncta being very irregular.

Foss.: Sat). Panelia, rare.

Ezccocconeis CL.

Cocconeis molesta ΚϋΤΖ. var. Lindbergii n. var. -— Pl..
4, f. 86 a, b.

Frusbule elliptical, 20—22 μ. in length, 9-11 μ in breadth.
Areas undistincb. Epitheca with 20 slightly radiate striae in
10 μ, composed of elongated puncta, ‘che valve thus appearing
longitudinally lineabed. Hypotheca with 23 finely punctate,
radiate striae in 10 μ. ΝΟ marginal line.

Foss.: Kk. Knj'asha (mar. dep).

Differs from the type by the 1655 61056 striae.

Cocconeis dirupta GREG. — V. H. Syn. Tab. 22 f. 13—15.
Foss.: Nyl. Kyrkslatt.
Distr. (mar,) Arctic a. Antarctic Seas; ubiquist.

Cocconeis Oestrupii nob. — Syn. Cocconez's sp. Θ5ΤΒ. D.
N.-E. Greenl., p. 214, Tab. 13, f. 17.—2100n.nost.Pl. 4, f. 87.

Frustule elliptical, 30—35 μ in length, 17—21 μ in breadth.
Epitheca with a narrow linear area and slightly radiate, deli-
cate striae, 11 in 10 μ. Hypobheca with 11 radiate, finely
punctuate striae in 10 μ, vanishing towards the centrum. A
marginal ring with 6 alveoli in 10 pff.

Foss.: Kk. Knjasha (mom).

Disbr. (mar.): Easb Greenland.

The lower valve, described above, exactly resembles
QSTRUP’S Greenlandian form, of which he has nob seen the
epitheca. The isolated epsthecae, to which the diagnosis refers,
can hardly belong to anything but this species, that· I have
named in honour of Mr QSTRUP. On single valves, I have
no more than Mr OSTRUP seen any ring. If the frustule,
drawn in fig. 87, thus belongs to this species cannot be stated
with certainty.

Cocconeis pulchella n. sp. —— Pl. 2, f. 51 a, b.

Valves elliptical, 32 μ, in length, 20 μ in breadth. Epi-
theca with a linear, axial area and large lateral, semi-elliptical
areas, On each side of the axial area a narrow, linear band
