Frustule genuflexed, elliptical, with abruptly protracted,
capitato ends. Length 11—12 μ, breadth 6 μ. Epitheca
without axia] area, with a horseshoe-formed marginal area on
one side of the valve, which side often is less inflated than
the opposite, sometimes subundulated side. Striae 13—14 in

This well defined small variety is closely allied to the
var. Haynaldii SAARSCH (from Ecuador), by the capitate,
ends and smooth striae, but scarcely half as long, by about
the same breadth.
