The specimen, drawn in fig. 54, agrees well with Cmcviss’s
Aclznanthes pennata in size and outline. Only it has distinct-‚ly
punctate striae, the puncta forming straight transversal as
well as longitudinal rows, 10 in 10 μ, whereas CLEVE's figure
has been delineat-ed with smooth striae. As the Synopsis
(II, p. 194) does not tell anything about the nature of the
striae, the identification of my form with Aclm. pennata is
not perfectly certain. It is, however, probable that all true
forms of Achnanthes brevz'pes have punc-tate striae, thus also
the latter variety·

Frustule almost cylindrical, genuflexed, with broad,
rounded ends, very slightly contracted in the middle, 60-
100 μ 111 length, 17 μ 111 brcadth. Upper valve with 6—7
rows of coarse, subquadrate‚ distant alveoli in 10 μ; 111 each
row 5 alveoli in 10 μ.. Alveoli forming somewhat undulating
longitudinal rows. Axial area distinct or not. Lower valve
with rather distant median pores and a linear axial area,
dilated in the middle to a somewhat broad, transverse fascia
and near the ends to small rounded areas, Striae subradiate‚
8 in 10 μ, coarsely punctate. Puncta quadrate, forming re-
gular longitudinal rows.

The frustule has double membranes, the inner one at
some distance from the other 011 the dorsal side and with
an acute corner leaning against the transverse ends of the
connecting zone of the outer membrane.

Foss: Kk. Knjasha, frequent in the marine strata.

Distr. (mar.): West and East Arctic Sea.

P. T. CLEVE first remarked this arctio vicariating form
for Achnanthes brevique& described it as a new species and
gave a figure of it in zonar view, showing the peculiar feature
of the double membranes. But, most probably, he has con-
fused it with another species, that I below have named
