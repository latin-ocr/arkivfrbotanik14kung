Aclmantlzes septam, since the valve, drawn by CLEVE in fig.
22b (D. Aret. Sea, Tab. 4), belongs to the latter species.
Both of the species in question occurring rather abundantly
in the Knjasha-samples‚ I have been able to compare them
closely in valvar view, and state their difference, which may
be seen when comparing the figures 55—57 of this paper.

Later on, CLEVE has united Aclm. arabica with Achnanthes
subsessilis Kooez„ in which I cannot agree with him. These
forms are certainly quite different in general structure, habi-
tually, and in size. The numbers of 30—50 μ for the length
and 10-—11 μ for the breadth‚ given in CLEVE’s Synopsis for
Achnanthes brevipes var. intermedia, apply to the true Ach-
nanthes suboessilis, but not to the considerably larger Ach-
nantlzes arctica, for which CLEVE himself in his original de- ’
scription states a length of 48 μ, which to judge from the
figure must be a misprint for 96 μ. or more, a heigth of 24 μ
and a breadth of 17 μ (as in my form). In Mar. d. ost-
Gronl„ p. 408, OSTRUP follows CLEVE in uniting the two
different forms Aclmanthes subsessilzsss and Achnanthes arc-
tica,· moreover he has not remarked the complexity of the
latter, sensu Clevmss, and figures as »Aclmantlces subsessilis var.
incurvata» a constricted form of Aclcn. septam.

Only for the case that Aclmanthes arctica be a sporangial
form, it could possibly be the same species as Achn. septam.

Achnanthes septata n. sp. — Pl. 2, f. 57 a, b. —— Syn.
Achnantlzidium arcticum CL. p. p. D. Aret. Sea, Tab. 4, f. 22 b.
Frustule linear, genuflexed‚ with subcuneate, obtuse ends
and broad, distinet diaphragms at the ends. Length of the
valves 70—1009„ breadth 14—17 μ. Lower valve with an
indistinct axial area and no areas at the ends. Central area
a narrow, transverse fascia; centra] pores approximate. Striae
subradiate, 6 in 10 μ, composed of coarse, quadrate puncta,
forming straight longitudinal rows. Upper valve unknown.

Foss.: Kk. Knjasha, rather frequent.

Distr. (mar.): West and East Arctic Sea.

The diaphragms at the ends of the valves are a feature
common to this species and to Achnanthes qroenlandica CL. In
other respects, they, however, are different enough; in size
f. i., the latter being a smaller and more gracile form, only
5—7 μ, in breadth. Moreover, the eentral pores are not distant
from each other in Achn. septam, as is the case in Achn.
