qroenlandica (and Aclm.. arctz'ca). Also the diaphragms of
Achn. qroenlandica seem to be much less marked than in th(-
present species, not being· visible at all on mec’s figures
(D. Aret. Sea, Tab. 4, f. 23; Vega-Exp. D. Tab. 35, f. 3). In
OSTRUP’S figure of »Aclmanthes qroenlanclica CL. varo, Kystd.
Grflnl. Tab. 2, f. 17 they are represented. Finally‚ the dis-
tinctly quadrate puncta are coarser in Achn. septam, for
which reason they seem less distant, though there is almost
the same number of striae in 10 μ. in both species

From Achnanthes arctica this species is distinguished by
the presence of diaphrang, by the narrow fascia, by the
laok of an axial area and by the coarser alveoli. The size
is about the same.
