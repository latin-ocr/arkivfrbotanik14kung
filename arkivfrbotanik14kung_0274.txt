the case with Ep. Hyndmamzii, I think I have found a po-
sitive argument against the quoted hypothesis in the sporangial
frustule, drawn in fig. 81. It occurred in a sample from
Hindersmossen (Ab.) in the company of Epith. tumida, Η 3]ηᾶ-
manm'i a. O. species of the same genus. Length 170 μ; outline
irregular, ends somewhat rostrate.

Foss.: Kk. Knji‘isha, rare.

Distr. (fresia w.): Puy de Dome (fossil).

One specimen of this variety, hitherto known only from
France, was found together with a few other fresh-water
diatoms intermingled in a marine sample from Knjasha.
There were no other species of the genus Eimotia present
in the sample.

Foss: Kk. Knj'asha.

Distr. (fresh w.): Europe.

Only one specimen, 180 μ in length, 7 μ in breadth, with
8 striae in 10 μ. Ends dilatenl, damaged, as not to allow an
exact determination of the variety.

13—16. — Icon. nost. Pl. 3, f. 64.

Of. this well-known speeies, living in the Ladoga, but not
known recent from Sweden, I have found in a sample from
Ab„ Hindersmossen, a very large specimen, that has not the
typical outline of Eunotia Olevei. The valve is slightly gibb-
ous on the ventral side and gradually attenuated towards
the broad, obtuse to subtruncate ends. Length 335 μ, breadth
in the middle 43 μ, at the ends 22 μ. This form is most
probably a sporangial cellule of Eunotz'a Clevei, whose ordin-
ary length is quoted by CLEVE (l. c. p. 55) to be 110-180 μ.
Ι have found the fossil species to be most frequently about·
140 μ in length, though some specimens reach until 300 μ.
