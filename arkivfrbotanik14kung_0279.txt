A. CLEVE-EULER‚ DIAT. FLORA OF FINLAND. 59

The outline of the valve being very different: from that
o‘t¹ the other, broad—ended forms of Grammatopleora‚ present
in the same samples, I have distinguished this form as a new
species, though it is imperfectly known.

Striatella AG.

Striatella groenlandica OSTR. Kystd Gronl. Tab. 2, f. 16.

Foss.: Kk. Knj‘e'tsh33 a few specimens, probably belonging
to this species.

Distr. (mar.): Greenland.

Rhabdonema Korrz.

Rhabdonema arcuatum (AG.) KUTZ. var. maxima n. var.
— Pl. 3, f. 66 a, b, ο.

Valve semilanoeolate, with obtuse ends, boatshaped, 140
-150 μ in length. Cellulae of the annulus 5 in 10 μ. Dia-
phragms of variable heigth.

Foss: Kk. Knjeisha, with the type in the aretio-marine
strata.

This conspicuous form attains the size of Rhabdonema
Torellii CL. D. Aretie Sea, p. 24, Tab. 4, f. 20, but must be
different from that speeies.

In fossil deposits from the Lzsstorz‘na-epooh, Rhabdonema
arcuatum occurs copiously, bub in much smaller specimens,
about 40—60 μ. in length.

Rhabdonema Oestrupii n. sp. — Pl. 3, f. 67 a, b. — Syn.
Rhabdonema minutum ΘΞἹῈ. Mar. D. Usta-Gronl„ p. 454, Tab.
6, f. 77.

Valve 60—80 μ. in length, linear with inflabed middle
and round, suboapitate ends. Breadth 12—16 μ. Valve
striate; striae 7 in 10 μ, punotate. Diaphragms as in Rhabdo-
‘nema minutum Knmz.

Foss.: Kk. Knjeisha.

Distr. (mar.): East Greenland.

This species was described and figured by OSTRUP as a
big form of Rhabdonema minutum. As, however, the outline
of the valve is rather different and intermediate forms do
nob seem to occur, I think ib deserves to be made a new
speeies.
