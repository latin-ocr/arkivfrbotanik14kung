living pelagio Hyalodiscns stelliqer in the Skagerak. The latter
is only about 50 {³- in diameter. The figure in VAN Hsscssciz's
Synopsis represents an intermediate form, 7011. in diameter.

Cyclotella comta ΕΗΒ. var. oligactis (ΕΗΒ.) GRUN. —
V. H. Syn. Tab. 93 f. 18.

Foss.: Kk. Knjasha, rare.
Distr. (fresh w.): Lara.

Valve 30 μ. in diameter. Marginal striate zone about one
third of the radius; marginal puncta (pores) alternating with
2 or 3 striae. Five distinct channels. Centrum of the dise
covered with radiating rows of puncta, leaving a very small
blank annulus round two central puncta.

Foss.: Ab. Hindersmossen, in the undermost (eldest)
strata from the Ancylus—epooh‚ where also are found some
diatoms of braokish water.

This large and beautiful form makes a remarkable tran-
sition between Cyclotella comta var. radiosa and Cycl. bodanica.

With the former it has the rather narrOW‚ striate zone
and the fine striae of equal length in common, with the latter
the sive distinet ohannels and the large size. Moreover, the
disposition of the marginal puncta is strictly intermediate‚ as
these puncta alternate with two striae in Cyclotella bodanica,
but with three striae in C'yclotella comta var. radz'03a3 cfr A.
CLEvE-Eormz, Cycl. bod , p. 441. — Most probably the quoted
variety of Cyclotella balatonis PANT. (-—— G. comta ΕΗΒ.) is
identical with the present form. - Another related form is
Cycl. comta var. affinis GRUN. (V. H. Tab. 93, f. 11—13),
without visible channels.

Dist-r. (fresh w.): Spread in the larger and colder lakes
of Europe, as alpine lakes, lakes Vanern and Vattern in
Sweden.
