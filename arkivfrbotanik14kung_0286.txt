Cyclotella bodanica, EULENST. var. borealis A. CL. Cycl.
bod, p. 441, f. 2c.

Foss: Kk. Knjasha, rare.

Distr. (fresh w.): Lakes 01 Northern Sweden.

A few specimens with 2-3 channels were met with among
chiefly marine remains.

Cyclotella (Kiitzingiana van? ) abnormis n. var. — Pl.
3, 1. 69.

Foss.: Ab. Hindersmossen.

As the form figured is somewhat abnorm‚ with some of
the radiate striae perforated, I do not venture to give it a
name. Perhaps it is a form 01 Cyclotella Kiitzinqiana.

Cyclotella dubia FRICKE, A. S. Atl. Tab. 223, f. 23, 25.
—- Syn. Stephanodz'scus pulcherrimus A. CL. Arch. 1. Hydro-
biol. Bd 6 (1910), p. 211, f. 3.—Icon. nost. Pl. 3, f. 70 a—d

Foss.: Kk. Tuntsa; Ab. Hindersmossen.

Distr. (fresh w.): Limnetic in European lakes, especially
when small and shallow.

As Ι have remarked in the paper quoted above, this
species can be referred to the genus Cyclotella as well as to
Stephanodiscus. It has the characters of the former, viz, a
marginal zone wit-h a special structure, but the loculi some-
times are small, the whole valve then getting very similar
to that 01 a Stephanoclz'scus.

Ι have found this small species to be spread in many
Swedish lakes as well 36 in fossil deposits, and it may no
doubt in the future be recorded living also in Finlandian lakes.
From Steph. astraea it is easily distinguished by the single
rows 01 rather coarse puncta. In a fossil state, the valves
generally have the aspect shown hy fig. 70 d.

Cyclotella dubia FRICKE var. spinulosa n. var. — Pl. 3,
f· 7115111616 from the type by the presence of delicate thorns

inserted between every second alveolus.
Distr. (fresh w.): sparingly among the type.
