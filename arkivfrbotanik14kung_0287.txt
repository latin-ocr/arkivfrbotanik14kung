Stephanodiscus Niagarae GRUN. Franz Jos. L. D. Tab.
5, f. 1. -— V. H. Syn. Tab. 95, f. 13. μ- Icon. nost. Pl. 3,
f. 72.

Valve robust, not very convex‚ until 56 μ. in diameter.
Striae 10 in 10 μ, composed of rather strong puncta in single
rows, that, however, at an other mise a point, can be resolved
into double rows of fine puncta, asin Stephanocliscus astraea.
Spins, inserted at some distance from the margin, alternate
with three rows of puncta.

Foss.: Ab. Hindersmossen, rather common, associated
with Eunotz'a Olet-ez· in strat-a from the AncyZus-epoch.

Distr. ( fresh w.): Larger lakes of North America and
Europe.

Though I think the determination is correct, I give it
with reservation, having not had the opportunity of com-
paring the form from Finland with authentic specimens. If
so be the case, I quite agree with Mr OSTRUP (Danske Diat.
j. Afl„ p. 60) in the opinion, that Steph. Nz'ayarae is hardly
specifically different from Steph. astraea. It is a stronger,
more luxuriant form, from which the recent Steph. astraea
may have developed in course of time. In reality‚ the
structure of the valves is certainly more similar than it ap-
pears to be in consequence of the thicker valves ot Steplz.
Nz‘aqarae. The presence of a little blank, centra] annulus is
a character, common to this large form and the larger Cyclo·
tellas, belonging to the section of Cyclotella comta.
