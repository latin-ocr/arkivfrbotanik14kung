CHRISTENSEN, NEW FERNS FROM MADAGASCAR. A

Closely allied to A. Gautierz' HOOK. sp. 3 t. 184 from the
island of Nossi-be (Comoros)‚ of which Ihave an authentical
specimen. Originally Ι considered our new species a large
variety of A. Gautierzg with which it has the simple sterile
leaves in common, still now I think it the best to treat it
as a distinct species, different from A. Gautieri by its very
long-stalked fertile leaves that have a very long, linear-acu—
minate terminal pinna. The short-stalked sterile leaves re-
semble as to shape and size very much those of A. Gautieri,
but in the latter species their lamina is decurrent at base.
In one specimen is present a sterile leaf, which is long-stalked
and bears 5 lateral pinnae below the terminal one, but this
is, however, not long-linear but short and broad as the simple
sterile leaves. That specimen I have before with doubt re-
ferred to A. paclzysorum Bak. Journ. of Bot. 1891: 4, also
from Madagascar‚ although BAKER describes the side pinnae
as acuminate, and the sori as running from the midrib nearly
to the edge. BAKER, also, does not mention the differently
shaped sterile leaves, and I believe, therefore, that our species
is not the same as A. pachysorum.

Asplenium lineatum Sw. subsp. supraauritum C. (ΕΗΒ.
Pl. 2, Fig. 9.

Differt ab omnibus formis A. lineali a cl. CORDEMOY
(Revue generale de Bot. vol. VIII: 85 pl. V—-VI) depictis
pinnis omnibus vel inferioribus basi superiore lobo (rarius
pinnula soluta) magno ovato obtuse dentato instructis. Pinnis
6—12 cm longis, 1¹l2—‘2 cm latis, acuminatis, grosse duplicato-
de-ntatis, dentibus obtusis. Venis furcatis vel interdum bi-
furcatis. Lamina apice interdum prolifera.

Madagascaria: Moramanga‚ 18. 10. 1912, nr 476.

Provisionally I prefer to place this Aspleniumunder A.
lineatum SW. as a subspecies, although it is probable that it
really belongs to a distinct species. But if CORDEMOY is

right in placing all the different looking forms found by
him in Reunion under a single species, A. lineatum,· our new

form must naturally be referred ‘to the same. It approaches
A. affine Sw. in cutting and proliferous apex.
