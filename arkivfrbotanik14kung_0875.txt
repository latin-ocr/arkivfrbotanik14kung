interior of the country into a very hilly landscape. On the
beach itself there are sandbanks with a forest behind of
Pandantes and palms, principally Chrysaliclocarpus, as domin-
ating elements. chond the forest extend rather sterile
plains of sarid or large swamps with low species of Pandantes,
Typhonodornm (Araceae)‚ thinly growing Raphia etc. All the
year round there is a considerable rainfall, amounting to
2500 mm or more.

The Moramanga territory, also situated on the east-
side between the capital Antananarivo and the sea, with
an altitude of 700—800 m, is on the whole very hilly and
covered with thick rain-wood. Here and there small plains
and other woodless spaces are to be found. The eastern slopes
of the hills are woody, where as the western slopes are bare.
Moramanga is situatcd on the upper (west) border of a
large coherent extension of primeval forest, lining a great
part of the cast side of Madagascar on this level and
reaching down ·to the coast only at a few places. The rain·
fall. is perhaps somewhat greater than in the Tamatava
territory.

The Maj unga territory on the northwest side, traversed
by the rivers Makaobi and Baziboka‚ is thinly wooded
and has a relativly dry climate. The rainy season comes in
November--March The rainfall in a year is about 1,200
mm. Some small parts of the primeval forest, which are
(lamp all the year and whose principal characteristic plant
is Raphia Russia, abound in individual ferns.

The Tullear territory on the south east side has a
particularly dry climate, especially at the coast, where no
fixed rainy season exist-s. It consists principally of plat
plateaus gently rising towards the interior of the country.
The vegetation on these plateaus is thiu, low and shrubby
near the coast. The farther one gets into the country, the
greater is the rainfall and though it is always inconsiderable,
it is possibly already at Manasoa Tanony to speak of a
short but plainly marked rainy season during Dea-Febr.
The vegetation also changes in the interior of the country.
It gets higher and thicker. Low, shrubby fousts alternate
with dry grassy plains, partly ol? the savannah—type.
